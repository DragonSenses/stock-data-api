# Steps to create the project

## 1. Initialize npm

Create a folder named `/stock-data-api` where you want the project directory to be.

`cd` into it an initialize npm with

```sh
npm init -y
```

This creates a `package.json` file which allows us to interact with [npm - Node Package Manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-init). The `-y` parameter skips all the question prompts in the terminal.

```sh
npm i express
```
